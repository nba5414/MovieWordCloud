 Fast X maintains the key ingredients and takes them to the max. [Full review in Spanish] Tiresome in all the ways it should kick ass Roman and Tej have their banter&#44 and Cena&apos s Jakob brings some much needed self-deprecation&#44 but Momoa&apos s Dante is a delightfully catty bitch&#44 and really saves Fast X from getting bogged down in the franchise&apos s combo of gonzo idiocy and weepy telenovela Fast X devours every iteration of the franchise and spits the biggest&#44 fastest&#44 and most ridiculous parts back at you&#44 sometimes without chewing Vin Diesel&#8217 s Dom is particularly monosyllabic and earnest &#40 Vin does takes these films very seriously&#41 but mostly the rest of the crew turn up in scenes that are so disparate that it&#8217 s hard to connect with them All that we liked about the franchise is there including monster motors&#44 vaguely juvenile jousting &#40 we did find it funny when we were younger and more confused&#41 and a spot of street racing Just as surely as the Earth circles the sun&#44 there are some certainties to be found in the Fast &amp Furious franchise as it hits &#35 10 in the series A certain degree of improbability is acceptable in a massive action film but eventually the laws of physics do trump everything else. It shows clear signs of wear and tear in every boring chase that sends Vin Diesel down avenues to defy the laws of physics in his 1970 Dodge Charger R&#47 T &#91 Full review in Spanish&#93 pushes the envelope on everything&#44 reason be damned&#44 resulting in the high-octane excitement you expect&#44 though it makes the least amount of sense out of the entire series As a direct counterpart to Vin Diesel&#44 who still seems like the only one in the cast still taking any of this remotely seriously&#44 Momoa has quickly shot to the top of the list of series bad guys by being just as over-the-top as he can be There&apos s no telling how many more of these movies Diesel and Company have up their sleeves&#44 but at least this one tries its best to set the stage for a new trilogy with a befitting villain in Jason Momoa Look&#44 if you&apos re gonna see and Fast &amp the Furious you know what you&apos re gonna get You know there&apos s gonna be car chases&#44 you know it&apos s gonna be over-the-top&#44 but I still enjoyed this movie Fast X desperately wants to be a fun popcorn summer flick The film manages to achieve that status quite a few times&#44 but the runtime is so sprawling&#44 the script so nonsensical&#44 and the action sequences so drawn-out that it cannot sustain the levity Not the best Fast &amp Furious film but the fact that the film goes back to the basics and forgets about things like going into space makes it a worthy addition to the franchise Living on-screen life a quarter mile at a time now seems more like a variety show than a movie&#44 at least where all that recognisable talent is involved Fast X&#8217 s focus is action&#44 loads of it Many of which you&apos ve seen from Mission&#58 Impossible&#44 DC&#44 James Bond&#44 and even past Fast films It&apos s like listening to a band&#8217 s greatest hits album&#44 but only to realize that they are running out of original ideas This addition to the cinematic junk food action franchise doesn&#8217 t have amusing set-pieces that catch the audience&#8217 s attention Fast x saved the Fast &amp Furious Franchise for me Fast X brings back what I loved from Fast 5-7&#33 Jason Momoa injects the adrenaline rush this franchise truly needed to elevate the stakes&#44 the insanity&#44 &amp family We are probably facing the best &apos Avengers&apos movie with flashy cars&#44 sleeveless shirts&#44 the smell of gasoline&#44 and down-to-earth superpowers that we can savor
